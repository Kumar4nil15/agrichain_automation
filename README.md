# Agrichain – Longest Substring Automation Assignment

This assignment contains two parts:

1. **Program to find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters**
2. **Web automation of a sample website (agrichain.com)** which accepts a string and displays the longest unique substring length on the next page.

# 📌 Problem 1: Longest Substring Program (Python)

I used a simple sliding-window logic to solve this in O(n) time.

I implemented a simple Python solution using the sliding window technique.
The logic continuously expands a window, and whenever a repeated character is found, the window is adjusted.
This helps efficiently calculate the length of the longest substring with unique characters.
